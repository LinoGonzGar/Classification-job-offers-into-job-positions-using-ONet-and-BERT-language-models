# Job Offer Classification with BERT, DeBERTa and RoBERTa

This project trains and compares **three transformer-based models**  
to classify **job offers** into occupational families defined by the **O*NET database**.

---

## Models Used
- [BERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) (`bert-base-uncased`)
- [DeBERTa](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/deberta-base) (`microsoft/deberta-base`)
- [RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/roberta-base) (`roberta-base`)

Each model is fine-tuned on the **job offers dataset** and evaluated with the same metrics and hyperparameter search space.

Install dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

### 1. Prepare datasets

Your CSV files must contain:

- `description`: job offer text  
- `Label`: target occupational family (integer)

**Example:**
description,Label
"Software developer needed for backend services",5
"Nurse position available at local hospital",2

### 2. Train models

Run the training script for the desired model:

# Train with BERT
python train_bert.py

# Train with DeBERTa
python train_deberta.py

# Train with RoBERTa
python train_roberta.py

Each script will:

- Fine-tune the model

- Run Optuna hyperparameter optimization with:

- Learning rates: 2e-5, 3e-5, 5e-5

- Batch sizes: 8, 16, 32

- Weight decay: 0.01, 0.1

- Epochs: 10 (fixed)

- Save predictions to experiments/predictions_<model>.csv

- Log metrics to Weights & Biases
